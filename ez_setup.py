"""Bootstrap setuptools installation

If you want to use setuptools in your package's setup.py, just include this
file in the same directory with it, and add this to the top of your setup.py::

    from ez_setup import use_setuptools
    use_setuptools()

If you want to require a specific version of setuptools, set a download
mirror, or use an alternate download directory, you can do so by supplying
the appropriate options to ``use_setuptools()``.

This file can also be run as a script to install or upgrade setuptools.
